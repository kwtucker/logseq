	- # [[Dashboard]]
		- ## How to use this graph
			- Understanding my custom block [[Properties]]
			- ### [[Contents]]
				- I used the contents page as an "At a glance" view in the right sidebar.
				- #### Favorites
					- List of high level topics that have the input property of "Dashboard". This is more of a favorites list that is dynamic across graphs.
			- ### Journals
				- #### [[Rocks]]
					- These are tasks that are marked with [[ðŸª¨]], I limit them to max 3 per day and these are my big rocks for the day to get done.
				- #### Scheduled
					- These are mostly my routines and reminders that I need to follow up on something.
				- #### [[Tasks]]
					- All tasks marked with #t, are tasks I made actionable. This means I can do them in 5-10 minutes and the line is a clear thing I can do.
				- #### [[Projects]]
					- Project pages that have actions items. These pages need to have a page property of `status` set to `TODO` or `LATER`. The tasks within the project page must have a tag `#active` in the first task. Look at the [[Templates]] page.
