	- These are tasks that are marked with ðŸª¨, I limit them to max 3 per day and these are my big rocks for the day to get done. As the query allows you to see the sub-tasks itâ€™s easy to break these big rocks down into steps.
	- {{query (and "ðŸª¨" (or(task LATER ) (task TODO ))   )}}
	  query-table:: true
	  query-properties:: [:page :block]
